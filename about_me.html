                    <h1>about me</h1>
                    <p>I am a second-year student at UC Berkeley, studying Bioengineering with an interest in Neuroscience! I'm super passionate about being a maker and a scientist. I'm currently working in the Sohal Neuroscience Lab at UCSF Mission Bay, where I've been contributing to research on neural circuits and behaviors, and the effects of Psilocybin.</p>
                    <p>Growing up with a dad and older brother who enjoyed building, I found my own love for woodworking, metal fabrication, and just tinkering. In high school, I had the privilege of taking many shops classes, where I received a formal education in technical arts. At home, I love making little projects in our mini basement woodshop and helping my dad out with fixing things around the house. I'm interested in Neuroscience and biomedical devices. I created this portfolio in hopes of showcasing some of my work! </p>
                    <p>Outside the classroom, I'm either on the softball field, basketball court, or tennis court, or in the kitchen. Similar to woodworking, I grew up playing sports and enjoying exercise. I was a four-year four-varsity sport athlete at LWHS, was a junior/senior captain of three sports. I also served as a co-spirit coordinator of the executive student council, where I brought pride and energy to my school...and even mascotted! Besides that, I spent hours every day in the kitchen, creating new recipes from scratch or perfecting old ones. I like to say cooking and eating are my two favorite hobbies!</p>
