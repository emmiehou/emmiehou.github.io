            <p>I am a senior at Lick-Wilmerding High School, and I'm super passionate about woodworking and being a
                maker! Growing up with a dad and an older brother who enjoyed building, I caught some of that and
                have
                loved it ever since. I get the privilege to take woodshop and metal shop classes at my high school,
                and
                I love making little projects at home in our mini basement woodshop. After high school, I'm planning
                on
                pursuing a major in mechanical or biomedical engineering, or a related field. I created this
                portfolio
                in hopes of showcasing some of my creations! </p>
            <p>Outside of the technical arts, I'm either on the softball field or the basketball or tennis court.
                Similar to woodworking, I grew up playing sports and enjoying exercise. I'm a four-year
                three-varsity
                sport athlete at LWHS, was a junior year captain of basketball and softball, and will be a senior
                captain of all three sports this school year. I am also excited to be an executive student council
                officer, serving as co-spirit coordinator!</p>
            <p>Aside from shops and sports, I love spending time with my friends and family, listening to or playing
                music, and cooking!</p>
