                    <p class="blog-excerpt">I love being a tourist in my own city, so of course I had to take Zoey, my friend from Iowa, to the famous Union Square Ice Rink in San Francisco. We had a lot of fun, I only fell once...and got to see the beautiful lights and tree. There was a little street fair with a bunch of cute photo ops and vendors selling holiday treats, which was a nice surprise to walk through. It was a nice break to get out of Berkeley and take a break from studying over Finals week! Yay for Zoey to get to see more of the city!</p>

                    <p class="blog-excerpt">This is a photo of me extracting the brain in my first perfusion surgery!!! A perfusion is where we euthanize a mouse after it's been run in our experiements, and then run PFA through the heart to clear the body of blood, and then extract the brain to do anatomical analysis on regions of interest. Big step for me to learn how to perform this surgery. Definitely a bit queesy from the blood and guts, but I'm really proud of myself for learning and actually doing well! My fellow intern, Joey, does most of the perfusions for our PI, but she taught me super patiently and I managed to end up extracting 3 brains!</p>

                    <p class="blog-excerpt">I made porkchops with creamy orzo and roasted brussel sprouts. I got so bored of my pan fried chicken breasts every week...and decided to try a different protein this week. This was my first time making porkchops in a pan, my mom makes this really good porkchops and apples dish in the oven, so that inspired me to try a new method. I was worried they would come out too dry but they happened come out super juicy and I somehow got the cook perfectly. </p>

                    <p class="blog-excerpt">I was super sick this week but managed to make myself some homemade chicken noodle soup and garlic knots. It was delicious- and I'd like to think cured my sickness.. It was sooo good and really so much better than the canned stuff I usually have when I'm sick. I cooked it all without a recipe on the fly and it came out super rich and flavorful! Making things homemade really is just so much better.</p>

I try to make a nice meal once a week and usually I end up with lots of leftovers!! Here's some homemade hibachi with shrimp, zucchini/onions, and fried rice! I looove hibachi- when I was little, my family used to go to Connecticut every winter and summer break and my grandma would take my whole family, aunts, uncles, cousins, everyone all to this really yummy hibachi place. I loved it so much I used to play with my pretend food set and pretend I was the chef doing all the tricks and stuff!</p>
