                <p>a mobile kitchen cart combining industrial metal construction with a warm butcher block top, designed to provide both functionality and style in modern kitchens. this was my final project in my spring of junior year metalshop class. we were budgeted $120 to purchase materials, and had a span of 19 class work days to complete itâ€”which came out to about 24 hours altogether.</p>
                
                <h2>design process</h2>
                <p>the cart was designed to maximize utility while maintaining a clean, industrial aesthetic. started by creating a detailed design drawing with rough measurements on rhino. i then started building first by welding the metal frame, made out of square 1" metal tubing. spot welded over any exposed joint to ensure a strong frame. as i slowly built up the frame, i made the butcher block using various scrap strips, gluing them together, planing and sanding, cutting, and then finishing with beeswax oil. used a cnc plasma cutting machine to cut out the two panels, that would be the second and third shelves of the cart, using a simple rhino file. welded the panels onto the frame. cleaned and sprayed with clear-coat metal protectant spray. then i put in caster inserts, locking wheels, and used gorilla glue to attach the butcher block to the frame.</p>
