                    <h1>about me</h1>
                    <p>I am a first-year at UC Berkeley, studying bioengineering, and I'm super passionate about woodworking and being a maker! Growing up with a dad and an older brother who enjoyed building, I caught some of that and have loved it ever since.</p>
                    <p>I got the privilege to take woodshop and metal shop classes at my high school (Lick-Wilmerding), and I love making little projects at home in our mini basement woodshop. I created this portfolio in hopes of showcasing some of my creations!</p>
                    <p>Outside of the technical arts, I'm either on the softball field or the basketball or tennis court. Similar to woodworking, I grew up playing sports and enjoying exercise. I was a four-year four-sport varsity athlete at LWHS, was a junior year captain of basketball and softball, and senior captain of tennis and basketball, earning me the Athlete of the Year award in 2024. I was also an executive student council officer, serving as co-spirit coordinator!</p>
                    <p>Aside from shops and sports, I love spending time with my friends and family, listening to or playing music, and cooking!</p>
